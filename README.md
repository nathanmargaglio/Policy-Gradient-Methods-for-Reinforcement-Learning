# Policy Gradient Methods for Reinforcement Learning
An implementation of the "[Policy Gradient Methods for Reinforcement Learning with Function Approximation](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/1713-policy-gradient-methods-for-reinforcement-learning-with-function-approximation.pdf)" paper.

The [Policy_Gradient_Methods.ipynb notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/nathanmargaglio/Policy-Gradient-Methods-for-Reinforcement-Learning/blob/master/Policy_Gradient_Methods.ipynb) walks through the implementation of the paper. An [interactive Google Colab version](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13pjaEa-KM4GtZ_LbGNV7UMO9E0L3v7K8?usp=sharing) is also available.
